ðŸ‘‹ I 'm a final year PhD candidate in Tsinghua University.

ðŸ§  My research primarily focuses on non-invasive **EEG brain-computer interface (BCI)** technology using visual stimulation paradigms. I have two primary objectives: firstly, to explore the theoretical **information transfer limits** of sensory-evoked BCIs; secondly, to enhance the usability of BCIs in daily life by mitigating **calibration burdens** and developing wearable **in-ear** sensing solutions.

ðŸŒŸ My academic interests span a range of topics within neuroscience, including **intracranial recordings**, **neural oscillations**, **sensory representation** in the brain, and the development of **closed-loop BCI** systems involving brain stimulations. I am presently in search of an intriguing research area where I can immerse myself for the next few years.

Research Topics
======

1. **High-speed visual BCIs**

- Information transfer limits of visual BCIs: exploring the maximum achievable speed for EEG-based BCIs.
- White Noise (WN)-based broadband BCI: assessing whether SSVEP-BCI represents the apex of this technology or if further advancements are possible.

2. **Plug-and-play BCIs**

- Universal BCI implementation: exploring the feasibility of transferring BCIs seamlessly across subjects, tasks, and devices.

3. **Wearable biosensing technology for daily BCIs**

- In-ear EEG: visual and auditory-evoked BCIs based on conformal in-ear electronics tailored for daily use.

1. **Population-level sensory representation in the brain.**

- The temporal recepetive field of visual and auditory information: understanding how the brain represents and processes sensory information over time.
